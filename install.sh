# Facile Studio installer. This is a shim by design: the installation logic
# lives in `facile`, the suite installer, so the suite has exactly one
# implementation of it instead of one copy per repo. Canonical shape in
# CLI-STANDARD §2.2.
#
# Equivalent, once facile is on your PATH:
#   facile install sonde
#
# Every statement sits inside a function and main() is the last line, so a
# download truncated mid-flight executes nothing at all.
